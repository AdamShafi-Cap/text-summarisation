2.0.1,"This document outlines the assessment criteria for Personal Independence Payment (PIP). It explains how the assessment is structured, including how the activities and descriptors fit together to determine entitlement to each of the two components. It also includes the assessment criteria themselves and guidance for health professionals on how to apply them."
2.1.1,"A health condition or impairment may be physical, sensory, mental, intellectual or cognitive, or any combination of these. The impact of all impairment types must be taken into account across the activities, where they affect a claimant’s ability to complete the activity and achieve the stated outcome. For example, a claimant with a severe depressive illness may physically be able to prepare food and feed himself, but may lack the motivation to do so, to the extent of needing prompting from another person to carry out the task. However, some activities focus on specific elements of function. For example, Moving around relates to the physical aspects of walking."
2.1.2,"When assessing a claimant, the Healthcare Professional should consider all the evidence of the case and the likely ability of the claimant over a year-long period, before selecting the most appropriate descriptor to the claimant relating to each of the assessment activities, taking into account their level of ability, whether they need to use aids or appliances and whether they need help from another person or an assistance dog."
2.1.3,"In choosing descriptors, the Healthcare Professional should use their specific knowledge of the health condition or impairment as a measure of the level of disability that would be expected from the claimant's condition. For example, it is unlikely that mechanical low back pain is unremitting day after day because the natural history is of pain that varies from day to day, and it would be appropriate to make this observation in the report. However, it is insufficient for the Healthcare Professional to argue just from the general principle when justifying descriptor choices; the evidence has to relate to the specific claimant."
2.1.4,"The fact that a claimant can complete an activity is not sufficient evidence of ability. Healthcare Professionals must consider the following.

• Approach – what the claimant needs to do; how they carry out the task; what assistance or aids are required; how long it takes; whether they can do it whenever they need to; and whether it is safe.
• Outcome – whether the activity can be successfully completed and the standard that is achieved.
• Impact – what the effects of reaching the outcome has on the claimant and, where relevant, others; and whether the claimant can repeat the activity within a reasonable period of time and to the same standard (this clearly includes consideration of symptoms such as pain, discomfort, breathlessness, fatigue and anxiety). The impact of completing one activity on the ability to complete others must also be considered. 
• Variability – how a claimant’s approach and outcomes and level of functional restriction change over time and the impact this has on them."
2.1.5,Healthcare Professionals should not consider the point scores associated with descriptors or whether these will confer entitlement to the benefit if chosen by the DWP’s case managers (CMs). Healthcare Professionals should only consider whether the descriptor is appropriate to the claimant’s circumstances.
2.1.6,"For a descriptor to be able to apply to a claimant, the claimant must be able to reliably complete the descriptor. More information on this can be found in section 2.2."
2.1.7,"The impact of most health conditions and impairments can fluctuate over time. Taking a view of ability over a longer period of time helps to iron out fluctuations and presents a more coherent picture of disabling effects. Therefore, the descriptor choice should be based on consideration of a 12 month period. This should correlate with the Qualifying Period and Prospective Test for the benefit – so the Healthcare Professional should broadly consider the claimant’s likely ability in the three months before the assessment and in the nine months after."
2.1.8,"A scoring descriptor can apply to claimants in an activity where their impairment(s) affects their ability to complete an activity, at some stage of the day, on more than 50 per cent of days in the 12 month period."
2.1.9,If one descriptor in an activity is likely to apply on more than 50 per cent of the days in the 12 month period – i.e. the activity can be completed in the way described on more than 50 per cent of days – then that descriptor should be chosen.
2.1.10,If two or more descriptors in an activity are likely to apply on more than 50 per cent of the days in the period then the descriptor chosen should be the one which is the highest scoring.
2.1.11,"Where one single descriptor in an activity is likely to not be satisfied on more than 50 per cent of days, but a number of different scoring descriptors in that activity cumulatively are likely to be satisfied on more than 50 per cent of days, the descriptor likely to be satisfied for or example, if descriptor ‘B’ is likely to be satisfied on 40 per cent of days and descriptor ‘C’ on 30 per cent of days, descriptor ‘B’ should be chosen. Where two or more descriptors are satisfied for the same proportion of days, the descriptor which is the highest scoring should be chosen."
2.1.12,"If there is evidence that someone is awaiting treatment or further intervention Healthcare Professionals should take into account the facts and likely impact of that future treatment regime as they are evidenced at the date of the assessment, as part of their consideration of whether the person will meet the prospective part of the required period condition."
2.1.13,"The timing of the activity should be considered i.e. whether the claimant can carry out the activity when they need to do it. For example getting washed and dressed usually happens in the morning. For example If a claimant takes medication (such as painkillers) allows the individual to carry out activities reliably when they need to throughout the day then the claimant can still complete the activity reliably when required. For example, if a claimant takes painkillers as soon as they wake and they can get washed and dressed soon afterwards they would not score under these activities."
2.1.14,"If however, the medication did not start to work for a significant period such as to delay the claimant going about their daily business then the Healthcare Professional should consider a scoring descriptor. For example, if a claimant takes painkillers as soon as they wake but they have to delay the task of getting washed and dressed for 2 hours until the painkillers take effect then the Healthcare Professional should consider what help is required to carry out the activities reliably at the time the claimant would normally carry out those activities."
2.1.15,"When considering whether an activity can be undertaken safely, it is necessary to consider the likelihood of harm occurring and the severity of the harm that might occur. It is a common sense approach that when the severity of harm is high a lower risk is acceptable. When the harm is minor it may be acceptable for the likelihood of that harm occurring to be higher."
2.1.16,"The assessment takes into account where claimants need the support of another person or persons to carry out an activity, including where that person has to carry out the activity for the claimant in its entirety. The criteria refer to various types of support which are supervision, prompting and assistance.
"
2.1.16,"Supervision is a need for the continuous presence of another person for the purpose of ensuring the claimant’s safety to avoid a harm occurring. It is necessary to consider both the likelihood of a serious adverse event occurring, and the severity of the harm that might occur. To apply, supervision must be required for the full duration of the activity."
2.1.16,"Prompting is support provided by another person by reminding or encouraging a claimant to undertake or complete a task or explaining it to them but not physically helping them. To apply, this only needs to be required for part of the activity"
2.1.16,"Assistance is support that requires the presence and physical intervention of another person to help the claimant complete the activity, including doing some, but not all of the activity in question. To apply, this only needs to be required for part of the activity."
2.1.17,"A number of descriptors also refer to another person being required to complete the activity in its entirety. These descriptors would apply where the claimant is unable to undertake any of the activity for themselves, even with help."
2.1.18,"The assessment does not look at the availability of help from another person but rather at the underlying need. As such, claimants may be awarded descriptors for needing help even if it is not currently available to them – for example, if they currently manage in a way that is unreliable, but with some help they could complete the activity reliably."
2.1.19,"The assessment considers the varying stages of independence when undertaking daily living and mobility activities, from complete independence at one end of the scale to being unable to complete the activity at all, or without assistance at the other. For some activities, claimants will be able to exert a significant degree of independence by using an aid or appliance in order to help them to complete the activity."
2.1.20,"Aids and Appliances are devices which improve, provide or replace the claimant’s impaired physical or mental function, for example walking sticks to enable a claimant to move reliably, grab rails to assist with balance, wheelchairs to replace mobilising or liquid level indicators to substitute for sight when pouring liquid."
2.1.21,"For the purpose of the PIP assessment, aids and appliances may be everyday objects, but whether they are considered as aids in any particular case depends on how the claimant uses the object compared to how (if at all) it might typically be used by someone with no relevant impairment. Where the object would usually or normally be used in the same way by someone without any limitation in carrying out the relevant activity, it is unlikely to be considered an aid or appliance, for example sitting on a bed whilst getting dressed or using a pan with a rubber-grip handle when cooking. In those instances where claimants make use of such items, they should be scored as being able to complete the activity unaided."
2.1.22,"Aids and appliances do not include lens implants or joint replacements, but do include artificial limbs."
2.1.23,"When considering whether a claimant should be assessed as needing to use an aid or appliance, the Healthcare Professional should apply the following approach for most descriptors.

• Can the claimant carry out the activity reliably (that is, safely, to an acceptable standard, repeatedly and in a reasonable time period) and independently, or with the use of a commonly used device? If so, then descriptor A would usually apply. 
• Does the claimant need to use/rely upon an aid or appliance to complete the activity? If they use an aid or appliance which it would be reasonable to expect them to use e.g. a Zimmer frame when walking, could they then complete the activity reliably without assistance from another person? If so, then descriptor B would apply. 
• If the answer to both the above questions is no, then consideration should be given to whether the claimant must rely on prompting, supervision or assistance in order to complete the activity, in which case an alternative descriptor may be more appropriate."
2.1.24,"Where a claimant chooses not to use an aid or appliance which he or she could reasonably be expected to use and which would enable them to carry out the activity without prompting, supervision or assistance, Descriptor B will be appropriate, they should not be awarded a higher descriptor if using an aid or appliance would remove the need for prompting, supervision or assistance."
2.1.25,"It is reasonable to expect a claimant to use an aid or appliance in the following circumstances.
• If it is medically reasonable for them to use an aid or appliance. In some cases they may have already been given specific medical advice to use the aid or appliance. In others they will not, but would likely be advised to if they sought advice from a professional such as a GP or occupational therapist. 
• If the claimant is able to use, or could learn how to use the aid or appliance."
2.1.25,"An example of where Descriptor A should be selected in aids and appliances: Jane has installed grab rails to make it easier for her to lift herself up off the toilet. During the face-to-face consultation, it was observed that Jane could sit and stand repeatedly but with some stiffness and the Healthcare Professional considers that Jane could reliably stand after using the toilet without the rail. Even though it would be easier for Jane to use the rail it is not required to complete the activity."
2.1.25,An example of where Descriptor B should be selected in aids and appliances: Hayley is not able to lift herself off the toilet without the grab rail and would require assistance without it.
2.1.26,"The Healthcare Professional should make suitable comparisons across activities regarding the level of functional ability present. For example, if a claimant cannot chop vegetables without an aid due to weakness in their hands then it would be expected that they would struggle to undertake other activities requiring similar dexterity. Similarly – if a claimant drives a car but says they are unable to complete other activities requiring similar dexterity, the Healthcare Professional should explore this with the claimant."
2.1.27,"The Healthcare Professional should also consider the variability and fluctuation of a claimant’s health condition and the effect on their needs. Where there is variability, the Healthcare Professional should consider what the need is on the majority of days. For example, if a claimant can usually prepare food unaided, but occasionally needs to use an aid due to a particularly acute period in their condition, they will not be assessed as needing to use an aid as this is not needed most of the time."
2.1.28,"Mobility Activity 1 refers specifically to “orientation aids”, which are defined as specialist aids designed to assist disabled people in following a route, for example long canes."
2.1.29,"We recognise that guide, hearing and dual sensory dogs are not ‘aids’ but have attempted to ensure that the descriptors capture the additional barriers and costs of needing such a dog where they are required, to enable claimants to follow a route safely. Mobility Activity 1 therefore explicitly refers to the use of an ‘assistance dog’. Assistance dogs are defined as dogs trained to help people with sensory impairments. ‘Unaided’"
2.1.30,"Within the assessment criteria, the ability to perform an activity ‘unaided’ means without either the use of aids or appliances; or help from another person."
2.2.1,"Central to the application of all the activities within the PIP assessment is a consideration of the manner in which they are undertaken. For a descriptor to be able to apply to a claimant, the claimant must be able to reliably complete the descriptor."
2.2.2,"Considering reliability involves looking at whether the claimant can complete the descriptor in the following ways.

• Safely – in a manner unlikely to cause harm to themselves or to another person, either during or after completion of the activity.
• To an acceptable standard.
• Repeatedly – able to repeat the descriptor as often as is reasonably required.
• In a reasonable time period – no more than twice as long as the maximum period that a non-disabled person would normally take to complete that activity."
2.2.3,"This applies to every activity within the assessment. If an individual cannot reliably complete a descriptor then they should be considered unable to complete it at that level and a different descriptor selected. For example when a claimant is only able to complete an activity safely when supervised, the appropriate descriptor which refers to supervision should be awarded."
2.2.4,"Safely means in a manner unlikely to cause harm to themselves or to another person, either during or after completion of the activity."
2.2.5,"When considering whether an activity can be undertaken safely, it is necessary to consider the likelihood of harm occurring and the severity of the harm that might occur. We can use common sense to assess the balance between the risk of harm (likelihood of it occurring) and the severity of harm, in determining whether an activity can be done safely. 
• Where the severity of the harm is very high, then there will be a lower frequency of risk of harm for that claimant to be deemed unsafe carrying out the activity. 
• However, if the severity of harm is quite low, then the frequency of risk of harm must be higher (they need to be at risk for more of the time if the outcome would be less severe) for the claimant to be deemed unsafe in carrying out the activity."
2.2.6,"The risk of harm occurring also has to be higher than that for a non- disabled person completing the same activity. For example, most individuals will occasionally burn or scald themselves slightly while cooking; you must consider whether the claimant is at a notably greater risk of burning or scalding themselves as a result of their health condition or impairment."
2.2.7,"Harm includes damage to an individual’s health. For example if carrying out an activity could cause a substantial and sustained worsening of a claimant’s condition, meaning it is not safe for them to do it at all, the individual should not be considered able to complete the activity safely at the level described in the descriptor. Given the nature of the activities within the assessment this is likely to be rare."
2.2.8,"As made clear in legislation, harm is in relation to an individual or another person and therefore does not include damage to property. Damage to property may, however, be relevant to whether an activity can be completed to an acceptable standard or repeatedly."
2.2.9,"The regularity with which any risk occurs is also important. For example, if an individual has forgotten to take their medication at times in the past but ordinarily manages to remember unaided there is unlikely to be a risk to their safety."
2.2.10,"Even if the impact of the risk is significant, there must still be a real possibility that it will occur. For example, everyone is at risk of injury if they fall but for some the likelihood of falling is much higher, so the risk of injury occurring is higher. You must consider whether the risk of the harm and the severity of the harm that might occur are great enough to require continuous supervision for the duration of the task. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of preparing food where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.

• Fire as a result of not understanding how to use an electrical appliance or gas hob correctly. 
• Increased risk of cutting oneself or another person as a result of a health condition or impairment. 
• Burning or scalding oneself if, for example, an individual is likely to drop a saucepan or spill the contents. 
• An actively suicidal person may require supervision to carry out these activities or be unable to carry them out at all, due to the risk of self-harm posed by access to knives, naked flames and hot implements and food. Such a person is likely to have a care plan."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of taking nutrition where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
 • Choking."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of managing therapy or monitoring a health condition where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• Accidental overdose – for example due to cognitive or sensory impairment. 
• Deliberate overdose – the risk of deliberately taking too much medication with the intention to self-harm. Risk of overdose varies depending on the level of suicidal intent. Some people may need someone else to keep their tablets and administer them when required but require no other supervision to reduce the risk of suicide. This level of supervision is addressed by Descriptor B in Activity 3. 
• Taking too little medication, forgetting to take medication or not taking the correct medication at the right time due to a health condition or impairment. 
• Failure to carry out therapy which is likely to lead to a significant deterioration of an individual’s health condition as a result."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of washing and bathing where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• Falling or slipping which causes injury to the claimant. 
• Not being able to hear a standard fire alarm"
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of managing toilet needs or incontinence where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• Slipping or falling when getting on or off the toilet. 
• Sickness or infection due to an inability to maintain personal hygiene."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of dressing and undressing where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• Ordinarily there are no risks to this activity."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of Communicating verbally where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered. 
• There are no obvious risks to safety for this activity. It should be noted that the risk of being unable to understand emergency instructions is addressed by the activity itself."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of reading and understanding signs, symbols and words where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• There are no obvious risks to safety for this activity. It should be noted that the risk of being unable to read emergency signs is addressed by the activity itself."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of engaging with other people face to face where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered. 
• Becoming violent which presents a serious risk of harm to the claimant and/or another person."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of making budgeting decisions where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• There are no obvious risks to safety for this activity."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of planning and following journeys where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• Injury as a result of being unaware of obstacles, for example due to visual impairment. 
• Lacking a perception of danger which may present a risk of injury to themselves or others, for example as a result of running into the road. 
• Getting into an unsafe situation as a result of getting lost due to a health condition or impairment and being unable to resolve being lost."
2.2.11,"The following situations highlight examples of moving around where there may be a potential risk to the safety of the claimant or others. This list is not exhaustive and further consideration would be required as to the level of risk and whether mitigation, such as suitable aids and appliances, would be possible. Any risks presented by the claimant should be considered.
• Falling."
2.2.12,"""To an acceptable standard"" is not defined in legislation, which means it should have its ordinary meaning, i.e. that activities should be carried out to a standard that is acceptable. • When considering acceptability there is clearly a range, from what is not perfect but is sufficient at one end, to an extremely high standard at the top end. In order for it to be acceptable, the standard which a claimant achieves must fall within this range. An ‘acceptable standard’ is one which is “good enough”."
2.2.13,Repeatedly means as often as the activity being assessed is reasonably required to be completed.
2.2.14,"How often the claimant needs to complete each activity is not specified. The Healthcare Professional should consider how often they would normally expect each activity to be completed, for example you would normally expect an individual to prepare food three times a day, but to heat food only once a day. An Healthcare Professionals should consider whether the person is completing an activity less often by choice or due to their disability. In most cases the Healthcare Professional should use this norm as a benchmark when considering whether the claimant can complete the activity repeatedly."
2.2.15,"Some individuals may need to complete an activity more frequently as a result of their health condition or impairment. For example an individual with colitis may need to go to the toilet more frequently. In these cases the Healthcare Professional should consider whether it is reasonable for the individual to complete the activity more frequently as a result of their health condition or impairment, and if so what the reasonable number of times is in their individual case. It should then be considered whether or not the claimant is able to complete the activity that number of times."
2.2.16,"Where the act of completing the activity means the individual is unable to repeat the activity again, within a period when they could reasonably be expected to do so, they are likely to be considered as not completing the activity repeatedly. For example, an individual can prepare their breakfast, but the exertion of doing so leaves them exhausted and they are unable to prepare their lunch as a result, but by the evening they have recovered enough to prepare an evening meal. Because, after preparing breakfast, you would reasonably expect someone to be able to prepare a meal again by lunchtime, in this example the individual cannot be considered able to complete the activity repeatedly."
2.2.17,"As well as considering whether tasks can be repeated within a day, consideration should also be given to whether an individual is able to repeat a task on subsequent days. For example an individual may be able to fulfil the ‘Moving around’ criteria one day, but the exertion of doing so means they are unable to do so the following day. When considering repeatability over longer periods of days and weeks, the Healthcare Professional should apply the rules governing fluctuating conditions (set out in regulation 7 of the Social Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013) and consider which descriptor applies on the majority of days in that period."
2.2.18,"Symptoms such as pain, fatigue and breathlessness should be considered when determining whether an activity can be carried out repeatedly. While these symptoms may not necessarily stop the claimant carrying out the activity in the first instance, they may be an indication that it cannot be done as often as is reasonably required."
2.2.19,"The following situations highlight examples where an individual may be considered unable to repeatedly complete a descriptor in the way described due to the impact this would have.
 • A person who is able to stand and move 20 metres, but is unable to do it repeatedly as would reasonably be expected in a day. 
 • A person who is able to prepare a meal, but the exhaustion from doing so means they cannot then repeat the activity at subsequent meal times on the same day. This means they cannot complete the activity repeatedly as it is reasonable to expect people to prepare a meal more than once a day. In a reasonable time period"
2.2.20,Reasonable time period means no more than twice as long as the maximum period that a non-disabled person would normally take to complete that activity.
2.2.21,"The following situations highlight examples where an individual may be considered unable to complete a descriptor in a reasonable time period due to their approach or the impact their health condition or impairment has on them.
• An individual who becomes breathless and exhausted whilst washing and dressing, and needs two hours to complete these tasks 
• An individual who is physically capable of preparing a meal but whose need for formalised ritual means they take all morning to prepare breakfast. 
• Someone who, as a result of their health condition, has obsessive ideas around cleanliness and takes considerably prolonged periods of time to complete activities due to repetitive and extended hand washing."
2.2.22,"Worked Example 1:

Mr X is able to stand and move unaided. He can comfortably walk up to 150 metres at a normal pace. After 150 metres he starts to become breathless and to experience some mild pain. He can continue to walk but his pace slows. The pain and breathlessness gradually increases and after 250 metres he needs to stop and rest for about 5 minutes before starting to walk again. Mr X can repeatedly walk 250 metres, with short 5-minute rests in between for around an hour. After an hour of this, he needs a longer rest of about an hour before walking again. It takes Mr X around three minutes to walk 200 metres."
2.2.23,"Worked Example 1 (see 2.2.22):

In the Moving Around activity, the Healthcare Professional should work their way through the descriptors considering each aspect of reliability, to find the one that best describes Mr X’s ability to complete the activity reliably. A Can stand and then move more than 200 metres, either aided or unaided. B Can stand and then move more than 50 metres but no more than 200 metres, either aided or unaided. C Can stand and then move unaided more than 20 metres but no more than 50 metres. D Can stand and then move using an aid or appliance more than 20 metres but no more than 50 metres. E Can stand and then move more than 1 metre but no more than 20 metres, either aided or unaided. F Cannot, either aided or unaided – (i) stand; or (ii) move more than 1 metre."
2.2.24,"Worked Example 1 (see 2.2.22):

Based on the initial information, the Healthcare Professional should consider awarding descriptor A but needs to consider whether Mr X can complete it reliably.
• Safely – there is no evidence that this activity poses any risk to Mr X’s safety. He has said he experiences some pain and breathlessness and, while this may be uncomfortable, he knows when to stop and rest and there is no indication that this causes him any harm .
• To an acceptable standard – this is not an issue in this instance .
• Repeatedly – Mr X has to stop and rest for about 5 minutes after walking 250 metres, before he can start walking again, but he can repeat the activity for up to an hour multiple times in one 82 day. This is more frequently than would reasonably be expected so Mr X can be said to complete the activity repeatedly.
• In a reasonable time period – Mr X can walk the first 150 metres at a normal pace before he begins to slow, but it only takes him three minutes to walk 200 metres. Although a little slower than normal, this is a reasonable time period for someone to walk 200 metres and therefore Mr X can complete the activity in a reasonable time period."
2.2.25,"Worked Example 1 (see 2.2.22):

The Healthcare Professional therefore concludes that Mr X can stand and then move more than 200 metres and selects descriptor A."
2.2.26,"Worked Example 2:

Mr Y is able to stand and move with a walking stick. He can walk up to 60 metres at a slightly slowed pace with some discomfort. After this distance he starts to experience increasing hip pain. He can continue to walk, but his pace slows even further and after 100 metres he needs to stop and rest. This takes a lot out of him and for a few hours after, he is unable to go more than a few steps without experiencing further severe hip pain. It takes Mr Y between one and two minutes to walk 60 metres the first time."
2.2.27,"Worked Example 2 (see 2.2.26):

In the Moving Around activity, the Healthcare Professional should work their way through the descriptors considering each aspect of reliability, to find the one that best describes Mr Y’s ability to complete the activity reliably. 

A Can stand and then move more than 200 metres, either aided or unaided. 
B Can stand and then move more than 50 metres but no more than 200 metres, either aided or unaided. 
C Can stand and then move unaided more than 20 metres but no more than 50 metres. 
D Can stand and then move using an aid or appliance more than 20 metres but no more than 50 metres. 
E Can stand and then move more than 1 metre but no more than 20 metres, either aided or unaided. 
F Cannot, either aided or unaided – (i) stand; or (ii) move more than 1 metre. 

• Safely – there is no evidence that this activity poses any risk to Mr Y’s safety. He has said he experiences pain but he knows when to stop and rest. There is no indication that this causes him any harm 
• To an acceptable standard – this is not an issue in this instance.
• Repeatedly – Mr Y has to stop and rest after walking 100 metres and experiences increasing discomfort after the first 60 metres. It is then several hours before he can walk this distance again. As this is not as often as would reasonably be expected, Mr Y cannot be said to complete the activity repeatedly. He can repeatedly manage a few steps using his stick, which is less than 20 but more than 1 metre, therefore descriptor E best describes how he is able to repeatedly move around.
• In a reasonable time period –The walking speed which is deemed within a reasonable time period is 30 metres per minute. Mr Y can walk the first 60 metres in a minute or two. Although slower than normal, this is a reasonable time period for someone to walk this distance and therefore he can complete the activity in a reasonable time period. The Healthcare Professional therefore concludes that Mr Y can stand and then move more than 1 metre but no more than 20 metres, and selects descriptor E."
2.2.28,"Worked Example 3:

Ms Z can prepare and cook a simple meal. However, she lacks a perception of danger and occasionally cuts herself from mishandling knives or burns herself on hot pans. She is also impatient and does not cook food for as long as it should be cooked, as a result she prepares food that is lukewarm and meat that is not cooked properly – for example, chicken that is pink in the middle. Her sister usually has to be in the kitchen when she is cooking meals to make sure she does so safely and to remind her to leave food to cook fully."
2.2.29,"Worked Example 2 (see 2.2.28):

In the Preparing Food activity, the Healthcare Professional should work their way through the descriptors considering each aspect of reliability, to find the one that best describes Ms Z’s ability to complete the activity reliably. 

A Can prepare and cook a simple meal unaided. 
B Needs to use an aid or appliance to either prepare or cook a simple meal. 
 C Cannot cook a simple meal using a conventional cooker but can do so using a microwave. 
D Needs prompting to either prepare or cook a simple meal. 
E Needs supervision or assistance to either prepare or cook a simple meal. 
F Cannot prepare and cook food. 

• Safely – Ms Z lacks a perception of danger and has previously cut and burnt herself. The Healthcare Professional should therefore conclude that descriptor A is not suitable for Ms Z as she cannot do so safely. Descriptor B, descriptor C and descriptor D are also not suitable as they do not remove the potential danger from using knives and hot pans. Descriptor E reflects the support that Ms Z needs in order to ensure her safety while cooking and is therefore the most suitable descriptor regarding safety.
• To an acceptable standard – Ms Z is impatient and does not cook food for as long as it should be cooked. As a result the food is lukewarm and meat is not cooked through. The Healthcare Professional must consider whether that is an acceptable standard and in this case would conclude it is not. The Healthcare Professional should therefore conclude that descriptor A is not suitable because Ms Z is unable to do so to an acceptable standard. Descriptor B and descriptor C are also not suitable as they do not help Ms Z to complete the task to an acceptable standard. Descriptor D best describes how Ms Z is able to cook a meal to an acceptable standard and is therefore the most suitable descriptor regarding the standard • Repeatedly – this is satisfied as Ms Z is able to cook all of her meals. 
• In a reasonable time period – this is satisfied as Ms Z has not indicated it takes her an overly long time to cook her meals."
2.2.30,"Worked Example 3 (see 2.2.28):

In this case there are two possible descriptors – D and E. For a descriptor to apply, all aspects of reliability must be satisfied. As descriptor D does not describe a manner in which Ms Z is able to carry out the activity safely, the Healthcare Professional should select descriptor E."
